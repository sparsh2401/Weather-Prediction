# Weather-Prediction

Developed an interactive web application that predicts weather conditions (e.g., 
Cloudy, Sunny, Rainy) based on meteorological inputs using the XGBoost algorithm. 
Integrated Streamlit UI for real-time user interaction with sliders and dropdowns 
for features like wind speed, temperature, UV index, humidity, and more. Achieved 
high model accuracy and seamless prediction visualization. 
# Tech Stack: Python, XGBoost, Streamlit, scikit-learn, matplotlib
